Here's an implementation of the famous GOLD FINGER counter.

If you've ever interviewed for a developer / IT position within the last two years, I'm sure you know what this is already ;-)

There are two core files:
- goldfinger.jade >> Jade template file compiled to goldfinger.html 
- goldfinger.less >> LESS file compiled compiled to goldfinger.css

I'm sure using SASS would allow for a more elegant implementation.  But I first cut my CSS-preprocessor-teeth on LESS.

I guess you could call this 'A Tribute To My First...'
